 COMMAND LINE CALCULATOR USING PYTHON

The project is about a command line calculator made up using Python language.

The input will be taken on the terminal, so the output will also be shown in the terminal.

By copying the path of the program file in the terminal we can run it on the terminal.

In this calculator, we can perform various operations:
"add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, logarithmic, greatest common divisor, square root, maximum, minimum".

firstly, we are supposed to enter our number one and then number two in the terminal and then choose the operations available to get our required output.

Any operation we choose which is not available in the program then we will get an "Invalid Operation" as the output. 

The output for the operations available will be displayed as floating points up to 3 decimal places.

The advantages of a command-line interface include a CLI can be a lot faster and more efficient than any other type of interface.

It can also handle repetitive tasks easily, requiring less memory compared to other interfaces.
