# Command Line Calculator Documentation

## Overview

The Command Line Calculator is a Python-based program that allows users to perform various mathematical operations through the terminal. With this calculator, users can perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, logarithm, finding the greatest common divisor, square root, maximum, and minimum.

## Usage

### Installation
To use the Command Line Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository by running the following command in your terminal:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

2. Navigate to the directory where the calculator program file is located:
 
   cd your-repository

## To run the calculator, execute the following command in your terminal:

python calc.py and then provide the two floating point inputs and an operation from the operations given below (in case of an operation other than this an 'invalid operation' output will display) then press enter to run the code in your terminal.


## Input

The calculator prompts the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation from the available options. The numbers should be entered as floating-point values. The available operations are:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Power (power)
- Logarithm (log)
- Greatest Common Divisor (gcd)
- Square Root (square root)
- Maximum (max)
- Minimum (min)

## Output

The calculator provides the result of the chosen operation. The output is displayed as a floating-point value rounded to three decimal places. In case of invalid input or an unsupported operation, an appropriate error message is shown.

## Dependencies

The Command Line Calculator relies on the following Python modules:
- math: provides mathematical functions and constants
- argparse: makes it easy to write user-friendly command line interfaces

Please ensure that you have Python 3. x installed on your system to run the calculator.

## Advantages

- Command-line interface (CLI): The calculator offers a CLI, which can be faster and more efficient for performing calculations.
- Memory efficiency: The CLI requires less memory compared to other interfaces.
- Flexibility: Users can perform a variety of mathematical operations using a single program.
- Portability: The calculator can be easily executed on any system with Python installed.

## Limitations

- Input validation: The calculator assumes valid floating-point numbers as input. Invalid input may result in unexpected behavior or errors.
- Limited functionality: While the calculator supports common mathematical operations, it may not cover advanced or specialized calculations.

## Conclusion

The Command Line Calculator provides a convenient way to perform mathematical calculations through the terminal. Its simplicity and ease of use make it a useful tool for quick calculations and scripting.
